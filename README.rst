Installation
============

You can install the necessary packages in a conda environment of your choice by executing

.. code::

  $ pip install -e .

We recommend using a conda/mamba environment with python version ``<=3.11``.

If you want to use features from the NRAO CASAtools package, make sure you are using python 3.10 or 3.11.
